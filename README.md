This repository presents the findings of a study evaluating three distinct machine learning approaches for sentiment classification on Turkish e-commerce reviews related to environmentally conscious, or "green," products. The goal was to assess the effectiveness of classical models versus a state-of-the-art transformer-based model in handling the linguistic challenges of Turkish, particularly within the specialized domain of sustainability-oriented consumer comments.DatasetSource: Real-world product reviews scraped from Trendyol, one of Turkey's largest online marketplaces.Focus: Preprocessed and filtered user-generated comments that explicitly reference sustainability-oriented themes. This provides a domain-specific dataset for consumer analytics in green commerce.Methodology & ModelsThree primary sentiment classification approaches were investigated:Logistic Regression (LR): A classical linear model serving as a strong baseline.Support Vector Classification (SVC): Another robust classical machine learning model.Fine-tuned BERTurk Model: A state-of-the-art transformer architecture pre-trained on Turkish text, fine-tuned specifically for this sentiment task.Key FindingsModelAccuracyMacro-averaged F1-ScoreStrengthWeaknessLRReasonably High$\sim$Struggles with Neutral sentiment.General performance is reasonable.SVCReasonably High$\sim$Struggles with Neutral sentiment.General performance is reasonable.BERTurk0.910.67Superior performance in detecting Positive and Negative sentiment.Still exhibits difficulty in identifying Neutral expressions.Transformer Advantage: The fine-tuned BERTurk model achieved the highest overall performance, demonstrating a clear advantage in extracting sentiment from morphologically rich languages like Turkish.Neutral Sentiment Challenge: A common difficulty in Turkish-language sentiment tasks was observed across all models, specifically the struggle to distinguish and classify neutral sentiment effectively.Contribution & ImplicationsAcademic Contribution: Demonstrates the value of domain-specific deep learning for consumer analytics within the green commerce sector.Business Implication: Provides practical insights for e-commerce platforms and businesses to better understand and respond to public attitudes toward sustainable products, thereby informing inventory, marketing, and corporate strategy.Future WorkFuture research should focus on:Expanding Turkish Sentiment Datasets: Creating larger and more balanced corpora for better model training.Addressing Class Imbalance: Developing techniques to improve the model's sensitivity to underrepresented sentiment classes (especially Neutral).Refining Model Architectures: Developing or adapting models to better capture the subtleties and linguistic ambiguity of eco-conscious consumer expression in Turkish.
